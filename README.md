# Randy's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Randy and I am an aspiring computer science student and enthusiast. I like programming because of its unique way of bringing out the creative side of me as well as instructing me how to think of different and more efficient solutions to solve problems. I enjoy and find satisfaction in creating games and other random programs/projects and I have been involved in some small random projects during my high school career. I hope to continue building my experience with computer science whether its learning other computer programming languages or making even more intricate games!
