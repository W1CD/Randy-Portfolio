# Randy's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Randy and I am an aspiring computer science student and enthusiast. I like programming because of its unique way of bringing out the creative side of me. I enjoy and find satisfaction in creating games and other random programs/projects and I have been involved in some small random projects during my high school career. I hope to continue building my expierence with computer science whether its learning other computer programming languages or making even more intricate games!
